# Project Requirement Analysis


# Overview.

Hey there, MyWebClassers! It's your CEO Keith, and I'm back to talk to you about lean and agile practices. Don't worry, I promise to keep it funny!

So, imagine you're eating a giant pizza. You wouldn't try to shove the whole thing in your mouth at once, would you? (Unless you're trying to impress someone, but that's a different story.) No, you'd take small, manageable bites, savoring each delicious slice. That's exactly what we're going to do with our project tasks. We're going to break them down into small, manageable bites, savoring each delicious accomplishment along the way.

And just like toppings on a pizza, metrics add flavor and help us measure our progress. We'll be tracking metrics like deployment times, automated test times, user satisfaction scores, and even the number of high-fives we give each other for a job well done. That's right, folks, we're counting high-fives now. And just like how you measure the amount of cheese on a pizza, we'll measure our progress with these metrics to make sure we're on track to deliver a high-quality product on time and within budget.

Now, let's talk about the tasks themselves. We've identified a set of tasks that are critical for the success of our project. Think of these tasks like toppings on a pizza. Each topping adds flavor and texture to the pizza, just like each task adds value to our project. We'll be conducting legal research, implementing internationalization features, performing SEO research, and making the website accessible to all users. And just like how you might get creative with pizza toppings, we'll be getting creative with our tasks to deliver a website that our users will love.

But don't worry, folks, we're not just throwing a bunch of toppings on a pizza and hoping for the best. We'll be using lean and agile practices to streamline our workflow, increase collaboration and communication, and deliver high-quality work faster. It's like having a well-oiled pizza-making machine, except instead of pizza, we're making a kick-ass website.

So, let's get cooking, MyWebClassers! By adopting lean and agile practices, we can work more efficiently, collaborate more effectively, and deliver better results for our clients. And who doesn't want to deliver a website that's hot, fresh, and ready to be devoured by our users? Let's make this project a success and celebrate with a pizza party (or a high-five party, if that's more your style).

By completing these tasks, we will be better equipped to deliver high-quality content to our users while improving our development process and optimizing our infrastructure. Good luck and have fun, everyone!



## Step 2 - Break Down Epics into Smaller User Stories:

- Divide the epics into smaller user stories to make it easier to manage the project and track progress.
    - Write down each user story separately.
    - Each Story should be written from the customer or business point of view and consist of one measurable task i.e.
      it can be tested manually or automated

## Step 3 - Prioritize User Stories:

- Determine the importance and urgency of each user story.
- Prioritize the user stories based on their significance and start with the most critical ones.

## Step 4 - Estimate Effort Required:

- Estimate the amount of time and resources needed to complete each user story.
- Note down the estimation for each user story.

## Step 5 - Assign Story Points:

- Assign story points to each user story based on its estimated effort required.
- Use the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) to assign story points to each user story.

## Step 6 - Define Acceptance Criteria:

- Create a list of acceptance criteria for each user story.
- Clearly define what must be accomplished for each user story to be considered complete.
- Define positive and negative situations such as user entering in wrong data o making a mistake somehow

## Step 7 - Assign the user story to a team member and set a deadline for the task:

- Keep track of the progress of the project regularly.
- Ensure that user stories are being completed on time and according to the defined acceptance criteria.
- If any issues arise, make necessary adjustments to the project plan.
- Set deadlines early, so you have time to account for unexpected situations. Consider using Google Calendar or some
  other way to keep track of time. GitHub Project isn't very good at visualizing this
- Each Team Member is responsible for adding their user stories as issues to the project board in GitHub.
    - Take a screenshot after you load all your tasks into the project board and include it in the project analysis
      report.
## Step 8 - Hold a Sprint Retrospective Meeting or Discuss on the Discussion Board In Canvas
- Discuss how you can improve the requirement analysis and creation of the agile documents for the next sprint

# Submission Instructions
- Create a PowerPoint with your team during a meeting to capture your ideas for the agile documentation.
- All of your project documentation should be added to your repository's wiki see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis) for instructions on github wiki.
- Each team member must create a document and include a picture of their tasks after they initially add them to the task board
- Add a link to your project wiki to the document 
- Write a summary of your sprint retrospective for how your can improve this project requirement analysis and documentation writing in the future. 
- Submit the documents to canvas

# Project Analysis Scenario
## Project Introduction: Spoken by the CEO

Hey there, web wizards and tech enthusiasts! As the CEO of MyWebClass.org, I am excited to embark on a journey to create
a website that will knock your socks off! But how do we ensure that we create a website that truly meets the needs of
our users while delivering a top-notch experience? Let me tell you, it all starts with a solid foundation.

By focusing on the design and basic requirements of the website and limiting the use of technology early on, we can
build a foundation that's easier to build upon later. And you know what? We'll be moving at lightning speed through the
early stages of development thanks to static pages that require less technical expertise!

But wait, there's more! We're also adopting a lean methodology that prioritizes the most valuable features and functions
based on user needs. No unnecessary complexity or features that don't add value here! And with the help of our trusty
user feedback, we'll be creating a more user-friendly and effective website.

Now, let's talk project management! We're going agile, baby! And that means we've got some seriously detailed
documentation at each level: themes, initiatives, epics, and user stories. But don't worry, we'll make it fun with some
acceptance criteria to measure if we're meeting our goals and delivering a product that meets your needs.

And we can't forget about story points! These little gems are a way of measuring the complexity of a task or user story,
helping us estimate the effort required to complete the work. It's like a game of difficulty ratings, and we're rating
our legal research user stories at a 5-point task for some moderate complexity and our terms and conditions user stories
at a 3-point task for less complexity.

So there you have it, folks! We're building a solid foundation, prioritizing your needs, and having some fun with our
agile project management. Let's create a website that blows your mind!
